# Spam Detector

## Scenario
Internet Service Provider (ISP) company is tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. A [dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/challenge/spam-data.csv) is provided which contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. A supervised machine learning (ML) model needs to be developed for the dataset to accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes. Two classification models are created to fit the provided data, a logistic regression model and a random forest model, and evaluated to determine which model is more accurate at detecting spam. 

## This challenge consists of the following subsections:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Scale the features.
- Create a logistic regression model.
- Create a random forest model.
- Evaluate the models.

## Results
*The Random Forest Classifier model performed better with 96.7% accuracy, compared to 92.8% accuracy with the Logistic Regression model.*

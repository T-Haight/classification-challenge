# Spam Detector

## Background
Internet Service Provider (ISP) are tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. The dataset from https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/challenge/spam-data.csv contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. In this project, supervised machine learning (ML) models are developed for the dataset and accurately detects spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes. Two classification models are created to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam - a logistic regression model and a random forest model.

## This challenge consists of the following subsections:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Scale the features.
- Create a logistic regression model.
- Create a random forest model.
- Evaluate the models.

## Results
*The Random Forest Classifier model performed better with 96.7% accuracy, compared to 92.8% accuracy with the Logistic Regression model.*
